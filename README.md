# Sudoku Solver

> This is a full stack sudoku solver web app that can be used to solve a sudoku puzzle game. Enter the puzzle in the textarea and press solve for a solution. Node.js and Express.js are used to create a web server with the HTTP module. The back-end handles the client side HTTP requests, computes necessary algorithms to solve the puzzle and check for errors, then provides a response. The Chai.js and Mocha testing frameworks are used for unit and function testing.
